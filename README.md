A package delivery project, essentially the traveling salesman problem, to determine the best route and delivery distribution for daily local deliveries. Includes a central hub from which deliveries are made, the allocation of multiple delivery vehicles, and the need to contend with several package requirements and real-time restrictions.

## Usage
To get the code run the following from the command line:

```commandline
git clone https://github.comshanemcbryde/parcelservice.git
```

From the main directory where `parcelservice.py` is located run:

```commandline
python parcelservice.py
```
